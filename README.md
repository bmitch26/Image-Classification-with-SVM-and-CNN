# Image Classification with CNN and SVM
The following is an ongoing project with data collected from Kaggle, with additional fine-tuning to be added for completion. The task to be solved at hand is as follows: I am a worker for a social media platform, and my task is to create a solution  using deep learning to discern whether a post is holiday-related in an effort to better monetize the platform.

Task
Given the following six categories: Miscellaneous, Christmas_Tree, Jacket, Candle, Airplane, Snowman. I need required to classify the images in the dataset based on these categories.

To Solve
I will approach this task by utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) and Support Vector Machines(SVM). Using these two in tandem can be an effective method for feature extraction(CNN) for resulting classifications (SVM).
