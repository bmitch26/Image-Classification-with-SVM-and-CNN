# Supervised, Unsupervised, and Deep Learning Comparative Analysis for Image Classification
In the following hypothetical scenario, I am software engineer for a social media platform and my task is to experiment with different algorithm techniques to find the optimal solution for image classification. Given the following six categories: Christmas_Tree, Jacket, Candle, Airplane, Snowman, and Miscellaneous, I need to classify the images in the dataset based on these categories.

I approach this task by utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1. Results show that greatest accuracy results from neural networks although it has the greatest training time and requires a large training set, and is the recommended solution for large datasets. If a small dataset is used however, SVM is my recommended approach.
